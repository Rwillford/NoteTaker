# Note Taker 

## User Story
AS A small business owner<br>
I WANT to be able to write and save notes<br>
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a note-taking application<br>
WHEN I open the Note Taker<br>
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page<br>
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br>
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text<br>
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
WHEN I click on the Save icon<br>
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes<br>
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column<br>
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column<br>
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page<br>
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column<br>

### My Story
When given the starter code, I took it and structed it like the zookeeper assignment<br>
I created the server.js and got everything connected there.<br>
I then made the note.js creating the function to make notes.<br>
Lastly, I created the routes files for the api and html and made them accordingly.
